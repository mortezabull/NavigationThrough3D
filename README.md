# NavigationThrough3D

This is my code for 806 course Project. I called it NavigationThrough3D. This is a 3D virtual environment that I created using Unity.

Using this project, users can navigate through a virtual scene with different navigation methods. Users can change the navigation methods, and move through the environment. Also, they have a few tools (Such as making a checkpoint, changing the navigation speed). In addition, they can interact with the interactable devices and control/manipulate them.

I have created the main code which include navigation through environment, changing navigation methods, and interaction with the devices. In final part I have to add the controllers and try to export it for mobile devices and fix the bugs.

Because the code has to be executed inside unity editor, I have to only put scripts here. 3D models are also inside of my unity folder.
